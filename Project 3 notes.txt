QUESTIONS:
    -scaling, feels okay at 1080 but gets too big beyond that - best way to approach?
    -header image scaling in mobile but not others?
    -better way of spacing cards out on homepage to make more even?
    -really struggling with animations 
        - lack of resources for css only animations to learn from. wasting time searching
        - can build in test files but struggling to implement into main files with other elements involved
        - because icons are solid elements, can't get hover area to be within the icon itself only outside?
